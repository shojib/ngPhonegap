To be tossed and lossed<br>and broken in the whirl of this fearful joy?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things rush on, they stop not,<br>they look not behind, no power<br>can hold them back, they rush on.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping steps with that restless, rapid music,<br>seasons come dancing and pass away---<br>colours, tunes and perfumes pour<br>in endless cascades in the abounding joy<br>that scatters and gives up and dies every moment."
